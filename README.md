# coder-template-api-python

Coder workspace template that provisions a developer environment for
[api-python](https://github.com/patelajk2319-coder/api-python), demonstrating
Docker-in-Docker on Coder: even inside a Kubernetes-backed, redirected
workspace, a developer can still `docker build`/`docker run` like they would
locally.

## Versioning
`task template` pushes a new Coder template revision named after whatever's
currently in `VERSION`, so bump it before pushing a new revision (pushing the
same version name twice fails — Coder requires unique template version names).

`task template` applies `terraform/coderd` (the `coderd` Terraform provider,
not the `coder` CLI) — a separate Terraform root from
`templates/api-python-workspace`, which is the workspace template's own
Terraform, executed by the provisioner on each build. `task workspace` and
`task logs` still go through the `coder` CLI directly — there's no Terraform
resource for provisioning an ephemeral workspace or streaming its logs.

## Prerequisites

### Control Plane
This repo pushes a template onto an existing Coder control plane — it
doesn't deploy one. Get these from that control plane's platform team:
- a reachable Coder URL (typically via port-forward)
- admin credentials
- a long-lived API token for the `coderd` Terraform provider
- GitHub external auth configured, so developers authenticate with their
  own GitHub identity on first build

### Required Tools (install via Homebrew)
```bash
brew install terraform coder go-task shellcheck
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

**You fill in:**

| Variable Name | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `CODER_URL` | Coder URL, from the control plane |
| `CODER_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `CODER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login, used by `task workspace`/`task logs` |
| `CODER_API_TOKEN` | API token for the `coderd` Terraform provider (`task template`) |
| `WORKSPACE_REPO` | Git repo the workspace clones and runs |
| `PROVISIONER_TAG` | Optional — routes builds to a specific external provisioner instead of the control plane's built-in ones |
| `TEMPLATE_OWNER` / `TEMPLATE_COST_CENTRE` / `TEMPLATE_TEAM` / `TEMPLATE_ENV` | Template governance metadata |
| `TEMPLATE_DEFAULT_TTL` | Autostop TTL for workspaces (e.g. `4h`) |
| `TEMPLATE_ACTIVITY_BUMP` | Extends autostop on activity (e.g. `1h`) |

Nothing here is auto-populated by scripts — every variable is yours to fill in.

## How it works

Each workspace is a single Kubernetes pod with two containers:

- **workspace** — the developer's shell/IDE, non-root, with a persistent
  `/home/coder` on a `gp3` EBS-backed PVC.
- **dind** — a privileged `docker:27-dind` sidecar. Since both containers
  share the pod's network namespace, the workspace container talks to it over
  `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375` — no socket-mount or host Docker access
  needed.

The `dind` privilege is scoped to that one container, in a per-workspace
namespace (`coder-ws-<owner>-<workspace>`) whose egress NetworkPolicy only
allows DNS, HTTP and HTTPS — same isolation as any other workspace on this
platform.

On first boot, the startup script clones `api-python`, then `task build`s and
runs it against the sidecar.

**Why a bare `kubernetes_pod`, not a `kubernetes_deployment`**: the pod's
`count = data.coder_workspace.me.start_count` means Terraform's destroy (on
workspace stop) calls the Kubernetes delete API directly on that exact pod,
with no intermediate controller that could independently keep it alive. A
workspace is also a unique, stateful, individually-owned environment, not a
fleet of interchangeable replicas.

**Disk usage**: `resources_monitoring` alerts in the Coder dashboard at 90%
of the 50Gi home PVC — a real ceiling, not padding.

**First build can take several minutes** if the cluster needs to schedule a
new node — Coder can only stream logs once the agent starts, so there's an
inherent gap with no visible progress before that.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patelajk2319-coder/coder-template-api-python.git
cd coder-template-api-python
```

### 2. Create `.env` File
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the values described in [Configuration](#configuration) above.

### 3. Push the Template and Provision a Workspace
```bash
task template    # push the template
task workspace   # provision a workspace
task logs         # tail the workspace's startup logs
```

## Local API Access

This repo is for whoever owns the template — developers should never need
it. Developers connect to a workspace running this template with:

```bash
coder port-forward <workspace-name> --tcp 8000:8000
```

## Available Commands

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `task template` | Push/update the template via Terraform, versioned from `VERSION` |
| `task release` | Tag and push the current `VERSION` as a git release (`vX.Y.Z`) |
| `task workspace` | Provision a workspace (`NAME=<name>` to override the name) |
| `task logs` | Stream startup logs from the active workspace |
| `task validate` | `terraform fmt`/`validate` + shellcheck |
